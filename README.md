# Dog Party

**Dog Party** is my first project assigned in my Turing MOD 1 class.

**Phase 1:** The goal is to accurately rebuild a website from a static comp provided. Next, a second static comp was provided and using the same HTML code but a new CSS file that comp was to be recreated accurately as well.

**Phase 2:** Both comps are to be mobile adaptable using media queries and checking success using dev tools.

If all goes well, JS is to be incorporated to build functionality into the header to allow the user to type a dog name into the input field, click the button, and have that dog name populate the h1

**Phase 3:** More button functionality is to be added to the main buttons. Tooltips are to be added to the elements in the nav bar. And each main column will be able to have the text editable.

## Project Status

Due to time constraints at Turing and moving swiftly onto new curriculum and projects, some elements in Phase 2 may still need to be finished and Phase 3.

## Contributions

Please do not contribute directly to the project, but if you have suggestions, I would be happy to consider and implement myself to help with the learning process. Please email me at q.farenwald@gmail.com

## Acknowledgements
